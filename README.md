# IoT and connected objects

This presentation provides an overview of the domain that is today called *IoT* or *connected objects*, from the perspective of the system integrator, who has to design and build a system fulfilling (more or less) detailed functional specifications.

The presentation includes a few links to some hands-on labs. More are in the process of being added.
